the algorithm will try each move (1-7) for itself then for the opponent
it needs a depth of at least 4
it's called backtracking because it will stop in case of a loss and come back to the previous move

the value of a move will be determined based on the number of win/loss scenarios
(at least for the first version, as it is far from optimal with forced win for example)

the opponent will always play the best move that he has
in case of equal scenarios, the algorithm will choose randomly which one to play
